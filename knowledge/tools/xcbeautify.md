## Description

xcbeautify is a formatting utility for Xcode build output that makes compiler output more readable and AI-friendly. It filters and beautifies the verbose output from `xcodebuild`, making it significantly easier for both developers and AI agents to identify build failures without searching through pages of unrelated compiler messages.

## Use Case

When building iOS/macOS applications with agents, xcbeautify helps:
- Reduce noise in build output
- Highlight actual build failures
- Make parsing easier for AI tools
- Improve agent-driven build automation
