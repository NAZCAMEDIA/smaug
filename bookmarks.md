## @koylanai - Trail of Bits Security Skills Analysis
> These 17 security Skills for Claude Code are really well-written.
>
> - Decision trees agents can actually follow
> - Authoritative sources with specific file paths
> - Nested references for deeper context
>
> My take is that this is the beginning of something massive. Trail of Bits works with DARPA and Facebook. They don't do things casually.
>
> Every company with technical docs will ship Skill packages, not because it's nice to have, but because agents won't adopt your product without them.
>
> Agents (or humans) won't read docs; they execute Skills.
>
> If you're thinking about how agent-readable knowledge should be structured or are building/leading a startup that plans to create your own Skills:
> I'd love to chat for 5-10 min to exchange ideas.
> DMs open.
>
> *Quoting @dguido:* .@trailofbits released our first batch of Claude Skills. Official announcement coming later.
